Visualization ideas:
Ellipse graph -- shows last five stock moves after this insider made a major trade (buy or sell).  

Are there useful visualizations?
One problem with a single good visualization is that under the necessary analytical tests, there is a lot going on and it is impossible to present a visualization showing 8 different tests/types of data in a simple way because that isn't simple.  Therefore, the visualization shown (if any) perhaps should be a function of what trigger gets hit.  

Sentence visualization:

Downward predictors.  
- This level selling activity precedes negative three-month stock performance in 82% of cases.  
- Three of the five officers are selling stock faster than they earn it.  
- On March 20, 2014, insider selling made up 15% of the stock's total volume.  

No relevant predictors.
  Want the data anyway?
  Want a chart?
  What tests did we run?
